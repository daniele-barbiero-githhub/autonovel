# Voice Profile

This file has two parts:
1. **Guardrails** -- universal rules to avoid AI-generated slop. These
   apply to ALL voices and are non-negotiable.
2. **Voice Identity** -- the specific voice for THIS novel. Generated
   during the foundation phase. Could be anything: dense and mythic,
   spare and brutal, warm and whimsical. The voice emerges from the
   story's needs.

## Part 1: Guardrails (permanent, all novels)

The full anti-slop reference lives in ANTI-SLOP.md (banned words,
structural patterns, detection signals) and ANTI-PATTERNS.md
(structural anti-patterns invisible to word-level checks). Both
apply to ALL voices and are non-negotiable. Read them before
writing anything.

The voice-specific guardrail is the smell test:

### The smell test

After writing any passage, ask:
- Read it aloud. Does it sound like a person talking?
- Is there a single surprising sentence? Human writing surprises.
- Does it say something specific? Could you swap the topic and the
  words would still work? Specificity kills slop.
- Would a reader think "AI wrote this"? If yes, rewrite.

## Part 2: Voice Identity (generated per novel)

Everything below is discovered during the foundation phase.
The agent proposes a voice that serves THIS story, writes exemplar
passages, and calibrates against them throughout drafting.

### Tone
<!-- Generated during foundation. Examples:
     "Mythic and weighty, like stone tablets being read aloud."
     "Warm, slightly breathless, like a traveler telling stories by firelight."
     "Spare and cold. Sentences like knife cuts." -->

### Sentence Rhythm
<!-- Generated during foundation. Not rules -- tendencies.
     "Long sentences for worldbuilding, short for violence."
     "Dialogue is clipped. Narration flows." -->

### Vocabulary Register
<!-- Generated during foundation. The word-hoard for this world.
     What does this world SOUND like? Anglo-Saxon blunt? Latinate
     baroque? Colloquial modern? A mix? -->

### POV and Tense
<!-- Generated during foundation.
     Third limited? First? Rotating? Omniscient?
     Past tense? Present? Does it shift for effect? -->

### Dialogue Conventions
<!-- Generated during foundation.
     Tags: "said" only? Action beats? No tags at all?
     How do characters sound different from each other?
     Subtext rules: do characters say what they mean? -->

### Exemplar Passages
<!-- 3-5 paragraphs that ARE the voice. Written during foundation.
     The agent calibrates every chapter against these.
     These are the tuning fork. -->

### Anti-Exemplars
<!-- 3-5 paragraphs showing what this voice is NOT.
     Not the generic anti-slop stuff above -- specific to this novel.
     "This is too flowery for our tone." "This is too modern." -->

### Rhetorical Tic Budget
<!-- Generated during foundation. Every voice has characteristic
     constructions that are strengths in moderation and tells at
     density. Identify the 3-5 most distinctive constructions of
     THIS voice and set frequency caps.

     Example for a DFW-inspired voice:
       "the kind of [noun] that [clause]" -- max 3 per 10,000 words
       "which was [recontextualization]" -- max 2 per 1,000 words
       "the way [extended simile]" -- max 2 per 1,000 words
       deflationary sentence endings -- max 1 per 5 paragraphs
       parenthetical digressions > 20 words -- max 3 per 1,000 words

     Example for a spare/Hemingway voice:
       "and" as sentence opener -- max 5 per 1,000 words
       one-sentence paragraphs -- max 2 per page
       dialogue without tags -- max 3 consecutive exchanges

     These are the constructions that make the voice distinctive.
     They are also the first things to become tics at AI density.
     Set budgets during foundation and enforce during revision. -->

### Punctuation Discipline
<!-- Generated during foundation. Punctuation is part of voice.

     Specify:
       Em dash budget: total per 1,000 words (typical: 2-3)
       Paired em-dash parentheticals: allowed? If yes, max frequency
       Semicolons: encouraged, discouraged, or neutral?
       Colons: for lists only, or for dramatic introductions?
       Parentheses: for true asides, or avoided in this voice?
       Ellipses: in dialogue only, or in narration too?

     Example: "Em dashes at ~2.5 per 1,000 words. No paired
     parenthetical dashes. Semicolons encouraged for connecting
     related independent clauses. Colons for dramatic reveals.
     Parentheses for digressions that are genuinely subordinate
     to the main clause. No ellipses in narration." -->

### Register Variation
<!-- Generated during foundation. The dominant register and at
     least one counter-register for emotional breaks.

     Specify:
       Dominant mode: "Long recursive analytical sentences with
         parenthetical digressions and self-qualifying observations."
       Counter mode: "Short flat declarative sentences. Physical
         detail only. No digressions. No qualifications."
       When to deploy counter mode: "Emotional crises, moments of
         genuine fear or grief, scenes where the narrator's usual
         apparatus fails."
       Minimum frequency: at least once per 10,000 words.

     The counter-register is what makes the dominant register
     survivable at length. Without it, even the best voice
     becomes monotone.

     Optional -- scale-shifting: If the voice zooms between micro
     and cosmic observation, specify the range (crumb-to-galaxy
     or room-to-neighborhood?), the distribution (clustered or
     even?), and whether zooms must connect to the argument or
     can be purely associative. -->
